Contextual help and video tutorial links for clients, right inside the WordPress dashboard and editor.

== Description ==

Helpy is a lightweight WordPress plugin built for web agencies and project managers who want to offer contextual help and training resources directly in the WordPress back office.

It displays a ‚ÄúHelp‚Äù panel inside the editor sidebar (Gutenberg) or as a classic metabox, and adds a Dashboard widget with global documentation links. You can define help links globally or per post type ‚Äî ideal for showing clients Loom or YouTube tutorials, documentation, or a ‚ÄúCreate ticket‚Äù button linked to your Redmine project.

The plugin is fully object-oriented, uses its own database tables, and provides a clean admin interface with import/export tools.

== Features ==

* Contextual help box in the editor sidebar (Gutenberg)
* Fallback metabox in the Classic Editor
* Dashboard widget with global help links
* Per post type or global help lists
* Link types: Video (Loom, YouTube, Vimeo), Documentation, Custom URL
* Optional Redmine integration (‚ÄúCreate ticket‚Äù button)
* Simple admin page with collapsible panels
* JSON import/export for duplicating configuration
* Custom DB tables (no data stored in wp_options)
* WP-CLI commands for export/import/doctor/seed
* Fully OOP architecture following WordPress coding standards
* Safe sanitization, capability checks, uninstall cleanup

== Typical Use Cases ==

* Delivering WordPress sites to clients who need onboarding or video tutorials
* Internal documentation or training for content editors
* Projects managed via Redmine or other issue trackers

== WP-CLI Integration ==

# Check installation
wp helpy doctor

# Export configuration to JSON
wp helpy export --out=helpy.json

# Import configuration from JSON
wp helpy import --file=helpy.json

# Seed example data
wp helpy seed

== Installation ==

1. Upload the helpy folder to the /wp-content/plugins/ directory.
2. Activate Helpy through the Plugins screen.
3. Go to Settings ‚Üí Aide projet (Helpy) to configure your links.
4. (Optional) Configure Redmine (base URL and project identifier).
5. Edit a post or page ‚Äî the Helpy box will appear in the sidebar (or as a metabox if using the Classic Editor).

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does Helpy work without Gutenberg? =

Yes. If Gutenberg is disabled, Helpy automatically uses a classic metabox instead of the sidebar panel.

= Where are the settings stored? =

Helpy uses its own custom tables (wp_helpy_links and wp_helpy_redmine) to avoid polluting the wp_options table.

= Can I export or migrate my configuration? =

Yes. You can export or import your entire configuration as a JSON file from the admin settings page or via WP-CLI.

= How does the Redmine button work? =

If enabled, Helpy displays a ‚ÄúCreate ticket‚Äù button that opens your Redmine issue creation page. Authentication is handled by Redmine ‚Äî no API tokens or credentials are stored.
